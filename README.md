# WebDev-MinorProjects
This is my First Git Repository.

This repository contains a collection of minor web development projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project focuses on practicing and implementing different front-end concepts such as layouts, styling, interactivity, animations, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
